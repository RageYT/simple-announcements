# Simple Announcements - A Basic and Simplified Announcer w/Easy Configuration
Simple Announcer is one of my first scripts, and many more to come. It's a basic script however, and since it is there really isn't much to it. The only important thing is the configuration file which you can change to however you like. I've also included a basic prefix so it stands out different to the other messages, such as player messages and what not.

## Current Features
* Minimal and optimized code, very simple and short
* Easy to change configuration and settings
* Time interval between each sent message
* Broadcast announcements with a permission based command.

## Planned Features
* ~~Permission based announcements such as an admin announcement~~

Have more ideas? Please do by all means share.
